# EZPR Context Highlighting Improvements

This document outlines the enhancements made to EZPR's comment positioning and highlighting accuracy based on Azure DevOps REST API best practices.

## Key Improvements Made

### 1. Enhanced Azure DevOps Context Parsing

**File**: `lua/plugins/ezpr/ezpr_be_ado.lua`

#### Before
- Only parsed `rightFileStart` and `rightFileEnd` 
- Limited context information
- No support for deleted lines or iteration tracking

#### After
- **Complete context parsing**: Supports both `leftFile*` and `rightFile*` positions
- **Iteration tracking**: Captures `pullRequestThreadContext` for tracking comments across code changes
- **Comment state detection**: Identifies active, resolved, and outdated comments
- **Enhanced positioning**: Determines primary position based on content type (new/modified vs deleted)

```lua
-- Enhanced context structure
discussion.context = {
  file_path = context.filePath,
  thread_type = context.threadType,
  
  -- Right file context (modified/new lines)
  right_file = {
    start_line = context.rightFileStart.line,
    start_column = context.rightFileStart.offset,
    end_line = context.rightFileEnd.line,
    end_column = context.rightFileEnd.offset,
  },
  
  -- Left file context (original/deleted lines)  
  left_file = {
    start_line = context.leftFileStart.line,
    start_column = context.leftFileStart.offset,
    end_line = context.leftFileEnd.line,
    end_column = context.leftFileEnd.offset,
  },
  
  -- Iteration and tracking context
  iteration_context = prContext.iterationContext,
  tracking_criteria = prContext.trackingCriteria,
  change_tracking_id = prContext.changeTrackingId,
  
  -- Comment state
  is_outdated = thread.isDeleted,
  status = thread.status, -- 1=Active, 4=Fixed
}
```

### 2. Accurate Column Position Conversion

**File**: `lua/plugins/ezpr/ui.lua`

#### Before
- Direct use of Azure DevOps column positions (1-based)
- Inconsistent highlighting accuracy

#### After
- **Proper conversion**: Azure DevOps 1-based columns â†’ Neovim 0-based columns
- **Accurate positioning**: `adjusted_start_col = start_col - 1`
- **Better validation**: Ensures column positions stay within line bounds

### 3. Enhanced Visual State Indicators

#### New Highlight Groups
- `EzprDiscussionHighlight` - Active comments (blue background)
- `EzprDiscussionHighlightOutdated` - Outdated comments (brown background, italic)
- `EzprDiscussionHighlightResolved` - Resolved comments (green background, strikethrough)

#### Enhanced Virtual Text
- **State counts**: Shows breakdown of active/resolved/outdated comments
- **Better formatting**: `ðŸ’¬ 3 comments by Alice, Bob (2 active, 1 resolved)`

### 4. Diff-Side Context Awareness

#### New Helper Function
```lua
local function get_discussion_position_for_side(discussion, side)
  -- Returns appropriate position based on diff side (left/right)
  -- Handles deleted lines (left side) vs new/modified lines (right side)
end
```

## Benefits for EZPR Users

### 1. **Pixel-Perfect Comment Positioning**
- Comments now highlight exactly the text range they refer to
- Proper handling of column offsets eliminates positioning errors

### 2. **Clear Visual State Indication**
- **Active comments**: Blue highlighting for ongoing discussions
- **Resolved comments**: Green highlighting with strikethrough for completed items
- **Outdated comments**: Brown highlighting with italics for comments on changed code

### 3. **Better Context Awareness**
- Supports both sides of diff views (original vs modified)
- Tracks comments across code iterations
- Handles edge cases (new files, deleted files, deleted lines)

### 4. **Enhanced Information Display**
- Virtual text shows comment state breakdown
- Clear indication of discussion status at a glance

## Implementation Details

### Azure DevOps API Alignment

The improvements align with Azure DevOps REST API specifications:

1. **Thread Context Structure**
   - Supports complete `threadContext` with both file sides
   - Handles `pullRequestThreadContext` for iteration tracking

2. **Position Accuracy**
   - Converts 1-based Azure DevOps columns to 0-based Neovim columns
   - Validates positions against actual line content

3. **State Management**
   - Tracks comment lifecycle (active â†’ resolved/outdated)
   - Supports Azure DevOps status codes

### Error Handling

- **Graceful fallbacks**: If precise positions unavailable, highlights entire line
- **Validation**: Ensures column positions don't exceed line length
- **Multi-line support**: Handles comments spanning multiple lines correctly

## Future Enhancements

Based on this foundation, potential future improvements include:

1. **Interactive State Changes**: Allow resolving/unresolving comments from UI
2. **Comment Creation**: Support creating new comments with precise positioning
3. **Iteration Navigation**: Jump between different code iterations for context
4. **Smart Positioning**: Attempt to re-position outdated comments to similar code

## Testing the Improvements

To verify the improvements:

1. **Load a PR with various comment states**
2. **Check highlighting accuracy**: Comments should highlight exact text ranges
3. **Verify state indicators**: Different colors for active/resolved/outdated
4. **Test virtual text**: Should show state breakdown in indicator text
5. **Multi-line comments**: Should highlight correctly across line boundaries

The enhanced context highlighting provides a significantly more accurate and informative code review experience in EZPR.
